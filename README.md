Jump Hash
---------
Minimal rust implementation of Google's Jump Consistent Hash algorithm, originally defined in
the '[A Fast, Minimal Memory, Consistent Hash Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2294v1.pdf)' paper,
implemented as close to the published C++ code as possible for clarity.

Test vectors from the [rust-jumphash](https://github.com/jedisct1/rust-jumphash) and [jmphash-rs](https://github.com/jeromefroe/jmphash-rs) projects.

No dependencies, works on stable.
